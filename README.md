# question 1

## part 1
Before running, please make sure you have the file titled `q1_snapshots.json` in the same directory as the file `q1.py`. 

In your python3 virtual environment in the correct directory, type in `python3 q1.py` and hit enter to run the program.

You should see a message indicating that the data has been processed, and the name of the output file. If there are any errors
with the program, you should see those displayed in the output. 

## part 2
In my initial attempt, I had created an intermediary csv file to store the player data with the `roster_day` included. I realized
I didn't need this file, and can just sort the data without doing all of the extra processes of writing/reading an additional file.

One interesting aspect of the problem was trying to brainstorm 

I noticed that on day 59, there is a player who has different values for `contract`.
